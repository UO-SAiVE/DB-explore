This repository contains an R script and data files to assist in teaching a short tutorial on data exploration using R.

The R script is written instructional-style, and should be relatively easy for someone with basic R knowledge to follow. Options exist to load data into the R environment directly usin the .RData file, or to interact with a Microsoft Access database. Note however that using the Access database will require an installed version of Access of the same "bitness" as your R installation, as well as the installation of the Microsoft Access Database Redistributable (again, of the correct "bitness") from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920.

The dataset is provided by the Yukon Governemnt, and more recent versions are publically available upon request.
